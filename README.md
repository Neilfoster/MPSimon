# MPSimon

MPSimon is a single page game based on the Simon game from the 1980s. I decided
to design the game to look like the iconic MPC drum machine and also using drum 
samples.The idea of the game is that MPSimon produces a sequence of drum samples
in which the user has to copy to progress to the next level.

It starts with one sample and as the the user matches the pattern generated by
MPSimon the sequence gets incremented by one sample each time. When the user can 
sucsefully match a sequence of 20 drum samples the game is won

## UX
The project was designed to replicate the look of the MPC drum machine. I added 
a different color to each pad everytime it is hit to give the user a visual
refernce aswell as an aural reference.
