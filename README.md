# MPSimon

MPSimon is a single page game based on the Simon game from the 1980s. I decided
to design the game to look like the iconic MPC drum machine and also using drum 
samples.The idea of the game is that MPSimon produces a sequence of drum samples
in which the user has to copy to progress to the next level.

It starts with one sample and as the the user matches the pattern generated by
MPSimon the sequence gets incremented by one sample each time. When the user can 
successfully match a sequence of 20 drum samples the game is won

## UX
The project was designed to replicate the look of the MPC drum machine. I added 
a different color to each pad everytime it is hit to give the user a visual
refernce aswell as an aural reference. 
> As an avid memory game fan I wanted to play a game that both challenged my
memory and give me a fun way to do it
> As an experienced drum machine user I wanted a challenging game that could 
really test my my memory, strict mode was exactly what i was looking for

## Features 
* Power Button - allows users to toggle on/off the power on the machine. When 
 its not switched on nothing will work.
* Start Button - Starts MPSimon producing a drum sequence in which the player
 has to repeat.
* Strict Mode - when switched on the counter will reset to zero and MPSimon
 will generate a sequence from the very start, this can be switched on or off
 at any point during the game. 
* Counter - Shows how many successful sequences have been completed by the user
 it will change as the player moves throught the game. When the player presses the 
 wrong drum pad the counter will display "NO!" and if the user successfully
 repeats all 20 patterns the counter will display "Win!".
* Drum Pads - Each drum pad genrates a different sound when selected by the 
 computer, in addition to this each pad also lights up a different colour to give 
 the user a visual guide. 
* How to play button- brings up a modal explaing all the instuctions and rules
 to the game.
